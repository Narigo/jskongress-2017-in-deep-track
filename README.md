## Notes Monday


### Leveraging free services to build a newspaper

Slides to Postillon presentation and how it was/is built.

Using Google Sheets as a database for posts?

Maybe Cloudflare Free plan with caching could be used without running in their limits?

Static site generators -> GitHub Pages which is probably not working out for that many page views.

Google App Engine?


## Notes Tuesday

### Future of Rollup JS

Lukas is the new maintainer, Rollup should be used for bundling libraries.

### Web Animations API

Slides?

### JS operators `|>` and `?.`

The discussion of this session seemed to continue a lot longer as I joined late. There were concerns whether it really 
is a good thing to pump out new features as they might incur a runtime overhead and whether TC39 looks into that during 
the stages.
